# Spatial4j Supported Formats

Spatial4j supports reading and writing Shapes to and from strings

 * WKT
 * GeoJSON
 * Polyshape (custom format based on https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm)


## Polyshape

The standard 'Encoded Polyline Algorithm Format' offers a compact way to encode a list of lat/lon pairs into a simple ASCII string.  In Spatial4j, we have extended this format to support a wider diversity of shapes.  In particular an encoded string has:


### Prefix Key
a prefix key defining the Shape type (point, line, polygon, etc)
```
  KEY_POINT      = '0'
  KEY_LINE       = '1'
  KEY_POLYGON    = '2'
  KEY_MULTIPOINT = '3'
  KEY_CIRCLE     = '4'
  KEY_BOX        = '5'
```

### Arguments
The format supports an optional arguments to support things like Circle (with radius) and BufferedLineString (buffer size)  If the character immediatly after the prefix is a '(', everythign up to the next ')' is considered an argument to the Shape

### Polygons with Holes
Polygons are encoded as:
'2'+encode(exterior ring)[')'encode(interior ring)]*

### Spaces
Each Shape in a geometry collection is seperated by a space


## Polyline Examples & tests
In general, it looks like this format is ~25% as big as GeoJSON and ~50% as big as WKT.  This is with data with low precision numbers (100.1 vs 100.123456) so that may be a low estimate

For this data, it looks like the polyshape format is ~1/3-~1/2 the size as the binary codec.

## Known limitations
- the format is optimized to store lat/lon points, very big or very small values may get lost in the rounding
- all values are rounded to: Math.round(value * 1e5);
- In the JTS version, a homogenous ShapeCollection will be read as MultPoint/MultiLine/MultiPoly etc
